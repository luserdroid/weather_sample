open weather api sample project

You must create your own account to get an api key. This must be added to the url as a param to retrieve weather data.

# Technical 

To send requests to the server we are using Retrofit. http://square.github.io/retrofit/

From the architecture point we added a module, which is doing the networking layer.

# Architecture

There is no architecture :-)... This is just a sample. Use it wisely.
